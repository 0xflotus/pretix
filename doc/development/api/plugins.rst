Plugin basics
=============

It is possible to extend pretix with custom Python code using the official plugin
API. Every plugin has to be implemented as an independent Django 'app' living
either in an own python package either installed like any python module or in 
the ``pretixplugins/`` directory of your pretix installation. A plugin may only
require two steps to install:

* Add it to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of Django in ``pretix/settings.py``
* Perform database migrations by using ``python manage.py migrate``

The communication between pretix and the plugins happens mostly using Django's
`signal dispatcher`_ feature. The core modules of pretix, ``pretixbase``,
``pretixcontrol`` and ``pretixpresale`` expose a number of signals which are documented 
on the next pages.

.. _`pluginsetup`:

To create a new plugin, create a new python package which must be a vaild `Django app`_
and must contain plugin metadata, as described below.

The following pages go into detail about the several types of plugins currently
supported. While these instructions don't assume that you know a lot about pretix,
they do assume that you have prior knowledge about Django (e.g. it's view layer,
how it's ORM works, etc.).

Plugin metadata
---------------

The plugin metadata lives inside a ``PretixPluginMeta`` class inside your app's
configuration class. The metadata class must define the following attributes:

``type`` (``pretix.base.plugins.PluginType``):
    The type of plugin. Currently available: ``RESTRICTION``, ``PAYMENT``

``name`` (``str``):
    The human-readable name of your plugin

``author`` (``str``):
    Your name

``version`` (``str``):
    A human-readable version code of your plugin

``description`` (``str``):
    A more verbose description of what your plugin does.

A working example would be::

    # file: pretix/plugins/timerestriction/__init__.py
    from django.apps import AppConfig
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    from pretix.base.plugins import PluginType


    class TimeRestrictionApp(AppConfig):
        name = 'pretix.plugins.timerestriction'
        verbose_name = _("Time restriction")

        class PretixPluginMeta:
            type = PluginType.RESTRICTION
            name = _("Restriciton by time")
            author = _("the pretix team")
            version = '1.0.0'
            description = _("This plugin adds the possibility to restrict the sale " +
                            "of a given item or variation to a certain timeframe " +
                            "or change its price during a certain period.")


    default_app_config = 'pretix.plugins.timerestriction.TimeRestrictionApp'


Signals
-------

The various components of pretix define a number of signals which your plugin can
listen for. We will go into the details of the different signals in the following
pages. We suggest that you put your signal receivers into a ``signals`` submodule
of your plugin. You should extend your ``AppConfig`` (see above) by the following
method to make your receivers available::

    class TimeRestrictionApp(AppConfig):
        â€¦

        def ready(self):
            from . import signals  # NOQA

Views
-----

Your plugin may define custom views. If you put an ``urls`` submodule into your
plugin module, pretix will automatically import it and include it into the root
URL configuration.

.. WARNING:: If you define custom URLs and views, you are currently on your own
   with checking that the calling user is logged in, has appropriate permissions,
   etc. We plan on providing native support for this in a later version.
