Reinventing ticket presales, one bit at a time.

Project status
--------------
The basic features are present and sufficiently stable. pretix has been in use for one event and
sold a few hundred tickets so far. There is still a bunch of features to come and there is probably
still a lot of bugs in there, but we consider it stable enough that we use it in production ourselves.

Therefore, we will upgrade path for all changes to come. If you want to use pretix in production, 
I invite you to send me an email so that I can notify you of changes and bugs that require your 
attention.

Since very recently we now have an [installation guide](https://docs.pretix.eu/en/latest/admin/installation/index.html)
in our documentation.
