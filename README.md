Reinventing ticket presales, one bit at a time.

Project status
--------------
The basic features are present and sufficiently stable. pretix has been in use for one event and
sold a few hundred tickets so far. There is still a bunch of features to come and there is probably
still a lot of bugs in there, but we consider it stable enough that we are aiming to provide an
upgrade path for all changes to come. If you want to use pretix in production, I invite you to
send me an email so that I can notify you of changes and bugs that require your attention.

We are still missing documentation, especially on the installation. This will come soon, as soon
as we consider it stable enough to officially recommend third-party installations.
