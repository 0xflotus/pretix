Reinventing ticket presales, one bit at a time.

Project status
--------------
The basic features are present and sufficiently stable. pretix has been in use for one event and
sold a few hundred tickets so far. However, many features are missing and the admin UI is far from
being complete, so we **do not recommend** production use yet.
