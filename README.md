Reinventing ticket presales, one bit at a time.

Project status
--------------
We are really working on it, but it will take a while. Currently, this is as unstable as it can be. Everything can change daily. Try it, hack on it, write pull requests, write documentation, translate it but don't use it and don't put data in it.

Maintainer
----------
Raphael Michel <mail@raphaelmichel.de>

License
-------
It's the AGPL. See the LICENSE file for more information.
